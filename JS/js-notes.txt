Good naming convention:

1. Use camelCase for variables and functions
Start with a lowercase letter, capitalize subsequent words.
let userName = "Alice";
function reverseNumber(num) { ... }

2. Use PascalCase for classes and constructors
Every word starts with a capital letter.
class UserProfile { ... }
const user = new UserProfile();

3. Constants
All uppercase with underscores for constants that don’t change.
const MAX_USERS = 100;

4. Booleans
Name boolean variables so they read like true/false questions.
let isLoggedIn = true;
let hasPermission = false;

5. Descriptive and meaningful
Avoid vague names like x or data unless in a tiny scope.
let reversedNumber = reverseNumber(12345); // good
let x = 12345;                             // bad

6. Avoid abbreviations
Only abbreviate well-known terms.
let htmlElement = document.getElementById("app"); // better than let el

7. Functions
Use verbs for function names — they indicate actions.
function calculateSum(a, b) { ... }
function fetchUserData() { ... }

8. Avoid reserved words
Don’t use JavaScript keywords like class, var, function as names.

9. Consistency
Pick a style and stick with it across your codebase. Mixing camelCase and snake_case is confusing.
